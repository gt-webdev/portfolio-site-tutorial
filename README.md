Tutorial code for creating your own personal website using HTML and CSS.

## Template?
This repository is a template. This means that you don't need to clone the repository and rather you can click on `Use Template` and then Github will start creating a new repository with this repository's code already included.

We will need this for when we deploy your site using another Github feature. For now, for set up, create a new repository using this code as the template before moving on to the next steps.
