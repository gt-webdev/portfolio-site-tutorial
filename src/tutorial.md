# Your New Website!

## What are we doing?
This tutorial covers Basic HTML

## What do we have to work with?
- `index.html` - The layout of the site and what will be seen when we deploy it to Github Pages. You will make the majority of your edits in this file. (Overriding our example code)
- `index.css` - A style declaration file that will have some elements that are nice to talk about as well as the special ones we'll have aside from the imported styles.
- Boostrap - A very comprehensive CSS styles library. The majority of our website's style will come from using Bootstrap classes.
- `index.js` - Most modern websites use some kind of JavaScript. For this tutorial, you do not need to edit this file (nor will we cover it in detail). Just know that this is what makes our website just a bit more *fancy*.
